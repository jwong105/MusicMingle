Has your favourite artist ever come into town, but you've had no one to go with? Because I have, and I regret not going to this day because they've never been back to Canada since!!! Anyways, this is a little side project I'm currently working on utilizing Spotify API to collect users most listened to artists and connect those with similar top artists so they can hopefully enjoy these amazing experiences togeher since it can be hard finding the courage to go to concerts alone :)

I plan to play around with setting up express as the backend, MongoDB as the database, and React with the frontend. I intend to include more cool technologies as I go along, but that's it for now!
