Has your favourite musical artist ever come into town, but you've had no one to go with?? I have and I regret not going to this day because they've never toured in Canada since!!!

Anyways, this is a little side project I'm currently working on utilizing Spotify's Web API and OpenAI API to collect users most listened to artists and connect those with similar top artists so they can hopefully enjoy these amazing concert experiences togeher since it can be hard finding the courage to go alone :)

I plan to play around setting up and using Express in the backend, MongoDB as the database, and React in the frontend. I intend to include more cool technologies as I go along, but that's it for now!
